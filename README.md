# TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PREDICTION

## Overview

This data science project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on various features such as passenger class, age, family members, gender, and embarkation port. The project explores the famous Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced survival rates.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing.
- Implementation of machine learning model decision trees.
- Visualization of survival patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Results

The project reveals key insights into factors affecting survival rates, such as the "women and children first" policy.
